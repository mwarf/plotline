All notable changes to Plotline will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-03

Speaker Intelligence release — pyannote.audio diarization integration.

### Added

#### Speaker Diarization (`plotline diarize`)

- Identify and label different speakers within interview audio using pyannote.audio
- Word-level speaker assignment via midpoint overlap with diarization segments
- Segment-level speaker via majority vote across words
- Optional install: `pip install plotline[diarization]`
- HuggingFace token management (env var, cache file, interactive prompt)
- Automatic `speakers.yaml` generation with default names and colors
- `plotline speakers` command to list and manage speaker configurations
- Speaker labels propagate through entire pipeline:
  - Enriched segments include `speaker` field
  - LLM prompts include speaker context for better arc construction
  - Review and transcript reports show color-coded speaker badges
  - EDL exports include `* SPEAKER:` comments
  - FCPXML exports include speaker keywords and clip name prefixes

#### Configuration

- `diarization_enabled: bool` (default: false) — Enable diarization in `plotline run`
- `diarization_model: str` — pyannote model name (default: pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1)
- `diarization_num_speakers: int | None` — Exact speaker count if known
- `diarization_min_speakers: int` — Minimum speakers (default: 2)
- `diarization_max_speakers: int` — Maximum speakers (default: 5)

#### CLI Commands

- `plotline diarize` — Run speaker diarization on transcribed interviews
- `plotline speakers` — List detected speakers and edit `speakers.yaml`

### Technical Details

- 67 new tests for diarization feature (387 total tests passing)
- `plotline/diarize/` module with engine, align, and speakers submodules
- Diarization is fully optional — not a pipeline gate
- Existing projects without diarization continue to work unchanged

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-27

Reporting Polish & Theme Explorer released — interactive theme navigation and reporting suite bug fixes.

### Added

#### Theme Explorer Report (`plotline report themes`)

- Interactive sidebar for theme navigation with segment counts and strength indicators
- Automated multi-theme intersection detection with visual badges and notes
- Client-side sorting (Delivery Score, Chronological, Theme Count) and search
- Cross-interview unified theme views (via `synthesis.json`) or per-interview fallback
- `plotline/reports/themes.py` — generator module
- `plotline/reports/templates/themes.html` — interactive report template

### Fixed

- **Review Report**: Corrected approval/rejection counters and persistent state saving using `localStorage` (fixing `file://` protocol issues)
- **Compare Report**: Resolved uncaught `audio.play()` errors and fixed message filtering under the `file://` protocol
- **Summary Report**: Improved narrative arc visualization with expanded role mappings and distinct colors for 'climax' and 'resolution' segments
- **Dashboard**: Replaced hardcoded "Run Next Stage" button with dynamic logic based on actual pipeline progress per interview
- **General**: Improved audio playback robustness across all reporting templates

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

Polish & Gaps release — cross-interview comparison, new reports, and cultural sensitivity flagging.

### Added

#### Cross-Interview Comparison (`plotline compare`)

- Side-by-side best-take comparison across interviews for the same theme/message
- Cross-interview score re-normalization (not per-interview min-max)
- Interactive HTML report with candidate cards, audio playback, sort/filter
- `plotline/compare.py` — core comparison logic
- `plotline/reports/compare.py` — report data builder
- `plotline/reports/templates/compare.html` — comparison report template

#### Transcript Report (`plotline report transcript`)

- Per-interview HTML report with delivery waveform timeline
- Sticky horizontal timeline header with scrolling segment cards
- Theme pills on segments, keyboard navigation, audio playback
- Per-segment delivery metrics (energy, pitch variation, speech rate, pause weight)
- `plotline/reports/transcript.py` — transcript report builder
- `plotline/reports/templates/transcript.html` — transcript report template

#### Coverage Matrix (`plotline report coverage`)

- Brief coverage analysis with three tiers: strong, weak, gap
- Message-by-theme grid visualization with per-message segment cards
- Progress bar and gap identification
- Auto-generated message IDs via `normalize_key_messages()` in `plotline/brief.py`
- `plotline/reports/coverage.py` — coverage analysis module
- `plotline/reports/templates/coverage.html` — coverage report template

#### Cultural Sensitivity Flagging (`plotline flags`)

- Optional LLM pass (Pass 4) to flag culturally sensitive content
- Flags segments referencing ceremonies, sacred places, spiritual teachings, naming/death protocols
- Updates `selections.json` in-place with `flagged`/`flag_reason` fields
- Auto-runs after arc in `plotline run` when `cultural_flags: true` in config
- `--force` flag to run even when disabled in config
- Clean slate reset on re-run (previous flags cleared before re-flagging)
- `plotline/llm/flags.py` — cultural flags LLM module

#### CLI Updates

- `plotline report transcript` — new report type
- `plotline report coverage` — new report type
- `plotline flags` — new standalone command
- `plotline run` — conditional flags step after arc when enabled
- `plotline compare` — fully implemented (was a stub)

### Technical Details

- 152 tests passing (up from 111)
- 16 tests for compare, 21 for transcript report, 22 for coverage matrix, 15 for cultural flags
- `commercial-doc` profile enables `cultural_flags` by default
