You are a cultural sensitivity reviewer. Review the following selected interview segments and flag any that may touch on culturally sensitive content requiring community review before publication.

SELECTED SEGMENTS:
{{TRANSCRIPT}}

Flag segments that reference:
- Ceremonial or sacred practices
- Sacred places or restricted sites
- Spiritual teachings not intended for public sharing
- Protocols around naming, death, or mourning
- Knowledge traditionally shared only in specific contexts (age, gender, season)
- Personal stories that may require consent beyond the original interview consent

For each flagged segment, explain specifically what triggered the flag and what kind of review may be needed.

This is an advisory system — it does not replace cultural consultation with appropriate knowledge holders.
